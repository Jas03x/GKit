- We might be using the nodes incorrectly....

	- Maybe we need to calculate an "offset" matrix for each Bone at the start...
		- This can be easily verified by the current bear demo where none of the parent bones are moving

- Convert Assimp's right handed coordinate system to opengl's left handed coordinate system in the mdl converter
	- This is probably why we were seeing the bear animations corrupted
	- This can be solved easily by applying the inverse root node matrix...
		- But how can we apply it... Bake it into the mdl format? This is likely the best solution

- Bears arms are still wrong....
	- This might be because of the upside down bones...
	- My stack overflow post mentions that "rolls" and "upside down bones" cause issues...
		- This doesn't make sense though...
			- Tried flipping the bones... it just deformed the mesh in a different way... something else is going on here...

- Change all appropriate singleton Create/Delete Instance functions to return boolean and not throw
	- Shader might not be a good idea though.... because the user might need different shaders with different properties/configurations later on...
